Implemented features: scale, rotation, Fourier transformation (brute force), Gaussian noise generation, pepper & salt noise generation, median filter, arithmetic mean filter, Gaussian filter, and Wiener filter. 

# Prereq
OpenCL acceleration is only for AMD GPUs, and you should configure [OCL SDK Light](https://github.com/GPUOpen-LibrariesAndSDKs/OCL-SDK/releases) first (don't change the default directory).
